# 42-fdf
A basic graphics program that displays a 3d wire-style height map.

Visual example below!

Developed:

Explicit colors as defined by a file.
Color default to a heat-map style gradient, of which the magnitude of the colors and scaling modifiers are defined macros.
Very fast rendering.

Using hotkeys, the user can:
Rotate, pane, and increase the zoom level.

Does not crash or leak.

Created using very limited access to normal C function (Or function that I created using this limitation, as found in libft), alongside with the minilibx graphics library.
